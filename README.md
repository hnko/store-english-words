# store-english-words
It's a app to store words and the meaning(translation) - It's useful to store the words that I'm learning in my english classes

To run it just write in the terminal python3 main.py
We have the main screen and it shows the options we have.

The first time we open the app we need to introduce a file name and then the data it's going to store there. The second time we open the app we can load the file already created or create a new one.
